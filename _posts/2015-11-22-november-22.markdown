It was on <strong>November 22, 1855</strong>, that regular passenger service by train began in Eureka. In very many respects, this event defined the "orientation" of the town of Eureka.

When the first pioneer families arrived in the community of Walnut Grove (later Eureka) they settled along the banks of Walnut Creek. When they identified those landmarks of their identity as a community&mdash;the Creek, the Old Spring, the church, and the cemetery&mdash;all of these were located in close proximity to one another. Therefore when the first building was constructed at Eureka College&mdash;Recitation Hall (now Burrus Dickinson Hall) in 1858&mdash;the structure was built with an identical facing on the north and the south sides since no one was certain of the direction in which the town would grow. Even though most of the community landmarks were located to the south, the railroad coming through the north side of the town eventually determined the direction in which the town would develop.

It was also on <strong>November 22, 1960</strong>, that ceremonies were held marking the removal of the "Recruiting Elm" from the Eureka College campus. This historic tree marked the spot where a gathering of college students formed the nucleus of what became Company G of the 17th Illinois Infantry during the Civil War era had an almost-sacred place in the history and folklore of Eureka College. From the 1920s onward the tree had been in decline due to Dutch Elm disease. By 1960 it was apparent that the Recruiting Elm could not be saved.

One can see a small part of the Recruiting Elm today in the Reagan Exhibit in the Cerf College Center. There was a small wooden bowl that President Reagan kept on his desk in the Oval Office during his presidency. The bowl was carved from the Recruiting Elm at Eureka College and it bore an inscribed passage: "Things of the earth may perish, things of the spirit are eternal."

It was on <strong>November 23, 1928</strong> that Bert Wilson announced his intent to resign as President of Eureka College in a memo that he addressed to the Board of Trustees. Wilson tendered his resignation before the anticipated student strike, but the Board did not officially accept Wilson's resignation until after the student strike had occurred.

Bert Wilson had presided over difficult years in the College's history and his administration had faced several contentious moments. His tenure followed the death of the nearly-sainted Louis Oliver Lehman's administration, and Wilson could never win in the inevitable comparisons that were made between the two college presidents. He also faced economic difficulties that were associated with the difficult financial times in America's heartland that preceded the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the looming Great Depression. Additionally, Wilson's position as a social conservative was at odds with the growing free-spiritedness of college-age youth in the 1920s. When students petitioned to have supervised dances held on the campus, Wilson's response was no - - but eventually he was forced to relent.

The primary issue that led to the student strike and the resignation of President Wilson was an effort to alleviate financial stresses that the College faced by "streamlining" the academic program that the College offered - - i.e. elimination of certain majors and general reductions in course offerings. Student leaders like Leslie Pierce and Ronald W. Reagan were able to convince their fellow classmates to protest these cuts by staging a five-day "work" stoppage.

This day was also a memorable one in football history at Eureka College. On this date in 1991 the Eureka College Red Devils played Georgetown College (KY) Tigers in NAIA Division II tournament playoff game. A crowd of 8,326 football fans attended this game.

Eureka College was one of eight teams participating in the tournament to decide the NAIA Division II national champion team. Eureka College lost to Georgetown College by a score of 42-14. Georgetown College eventually went on to win the National Championship by defeating Pacific Lutheran 28-20 just a few weeks later.

On <strong>November 24, 1892</strong>, the Eureka College Golden Tornadoes recorded their first football victory in the history of athletics at the institution. The game was played between Eureka College and Pekin High School. This victory took place during the second season of football in Eureka College's history.

This game took place before policies and procedures regarding intercollegiate athletics were formalized in the United States with the creation of the NCAA. At this time it was common for college squads to play games against local high school teams, but by the late 1890s college/university teams were only permitted to play against other college/university teams. One other interesting feature of these early seasons is that the football schedule often included rivals that were identified as community-based athletic clubs (for example, El Paso AC).

On <strong>November 26, 1910</strong>, William J. Whetzel died in a horrible industrial accident. Whetzel was one of the wealthiest and most successful individuals in the community of Eureka in the 1890s. He was serving as the Superintendent of Schools for Woodford County and he operated one of the first electrical plants in Eureka to provide that service to the town. In 1898 the Whetzel family built a home on Burgess Street adjacent to the Eureka College campus. Although Victorian architecture was fashionable at the time, the Whetzels incorporated elements of Queen Anne style into their home - architectural elements that were often representative of newfound wealth associated with the Industrial Age.

Whetzel went to his electrical plant on Saturday, November 26, 1910, with two of his young sons in order to make a few repairs on some of the machinery. He was standing on a tall ladder in the process of attaching belts to pulleys when the ladder collapsed and Whetzel fell into the machinery below. His body was badly mangled as he fell directly on to huge gears that were in operation at the time. Two of Whetzel's sons observed the accident and alerted local authorities.

The Whetzel House on Burgess Street eventually became property of the College. In its long history it has been used in various ways - a sorority house for Phi Omega sorority, housing for faculty/staff [Coach McKinzie once lived there], as a Black Culture House in the 1970s, the Student Development Office, and today, as the Admissions Office for Eureka College.

Henry "Heinie" Brubaker was born on <strong>November 27, 1878</strong>. As the one-man operations and maintenance staff for Eureka College for thirty-six years (1917-53), "Heinie" Brubaker was certainly one of the most colorful figures in the history of the institution.

Recognized for the "salty remarks" that were his trademark, "Heinie" was recognized unofficially by many as the College's "Professor of Profane Language." He was hired by Louis O. Lehman in 1917 when he was then employed at the Dickinson Canning Factory, and he worked until nearly the end of Burrus Dickinson's administration. During his time at Eureka, "Heinie" was much more than a campus engineer and handyman - he became widely recognized as an advocate of the students and he often was a decided adversary of the faculty and the administration.

"Heinie" had noticed through the years that several members of the administration had a fondness for fine Cuban cigars. One particular administrator had a habit of leaving his partially-smoked cigar on the bannister in front of the Administration Building if he had to step inside for a telephone call or other business. When that administrator returned, his cigar was always gone. Such efficiency had its own motivation. Many students realized that "Heinie" Brubaker also had a fondness for fine Cuban cigars.

In an interview upon his retirement at age seventy-five, "Heinie" said the following about the changes at the College from 1917-53. "There hasn't been a bit of change in the kids since 1917. The first classes I saw had their hell-raisers, just like the bunch nowadays. Seems sometimes like I spent most of my time following them around cleaning up after their crazy stunts . . . They may act crazy in school, but they always turn out all right after they graduate. They're all my friends, too. When they come back for homecoming they always look me up."

Henry "Heinie" Brubaker died in May 1969 at the age of ninety.

It was on <strong>November 28, 1928</strong>, that the famous student strike began. Students would remain out of classes for five days until their demands were met. At the end of the strike, President Bert Wilson resigned from office and the College promised not to institute the planned streamlining in curriculum and programs that had originally fomented the unrest.

Student leaders took their strike seriously and did not allow the five-day period to be wasted on frivolities. Student organizations sponsored daily tutorials that met in the residence halls and fraternity houses to keep students focused upon their course work. It was felt that to do otherwise, especially in advance of final exams, would have harmed the students irreparably and negated the "high purposes" for which the strike had been called.
