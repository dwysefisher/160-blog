On <strong>January 18, 1884</strong>, members of the Board of Trustees of Eureka College mulled over the idea of relocating the college to Decatur, Illinois. Even though the young institution, only twenty-nine years old as a college, had survived the Civil War and the financial panics of 1857 and 1873, it was believed that the school's location outside of a large metropolitan area was largely responsible for the financial exigencies that continued to plague the school. Maybe Decatur would be the answer. [Since Millikin University was not founded until 1901, Decatur had no institution of higher education at the time.]

At the very same time, another college in central Illinois was facing similar life-and-death decisions. Abingdon College had been founded in 1855 (just a week after Eureka College) and the school was also associated with the Christian Church movement. It seemed that the central Illinois market could not support two institutions with similar missions and the likelihood was that one of these schools&mdash;Abingdon or Eureka&mdash;would not be able to survive. It was determined that Abingdon College was in a more serious financial situation than Eureka (this does prove that everything is relative), and that Abingdon College therefore should cease to exist as a separate institution and should merge with Eureka College. This decision was reached in June 1885

Since the crisis of confidence of 1884&ndash;85, Eureka College has continued its mission for over the years. During that time there have occurred additional financial panics, the Great Depression, two world wars, and other international conflicts and crises. Through it all, Eureka College has survived by being a beacon of hope that somehow has overcome the overwhelming odds and the darkness amassed against it through its history.

It was on <strong>January 19, 1988</strong>, that the very first lecture was presented in Eureka College's newly-adopted Western Civilization and Culture course sequence. As it was originally conceived, the course sequence was designed to be a foundational experience for all students entering Eureka College by immersing them in an interdisciplinary course that integrated the various types of knowledge represented within the liberal arts and sciences. Although the course used history to formulate a chronological framework, it incorporated lectures from other disciplines&mdash;religion, philosophy, science, political theory, economics, art, music, and literature&mdash;to present a more complete appreciation of the cultural forces that have shaped western thought.

As it was originally developed, the Western Civilization and Culture series was divided into three semester-long courses. Most students took the first of these during the spring semester of their freshman year and completed the other two courses during their sophomore year. Because of the constraints presented by physical facilities at the time, each course was taught in two sections (Monday/Wednesday and Tuesday/Thursday) where lectures were presented in the Audio-Visual Room of Melick Library to sections of about 75 students each. On Friday, students would meet in smaller Discussion Groups (about 15 students per group) to take a weekly quiz and discuss the material covered in that week's lectures.

After the Cerf College Center was completed in 1994, the structure of the Western Civilization and Culture series was modified. During the 1994&ndash;95 school year, the series was changed to a two-semester course series that was taught to most students during their freshman year. The class lectures were held in Becker Auditorium which can accommodate the entire group. Discussion Groups still meet on Fridays to afford students an opportunity to discuss the week's material in a smaller group setting.

It is an unusual weather event that marks <strong>January 21</strong> in Eureka's past. On this date in <strong>1856</strong> one of the worst blizzards ever noted affected much of the Midwest and its impact was felt in this community.

Accurate meteorological records dating back to the mid-nineteenth century do not really exist, but there is abundant anecdotal evidence in letters, diaries, and newspaper accounts suggesting that the winter of 1855&ndash;56 was one of the coldest on record. In many parts of the Midwest that winter came to be designated as the second coldest of the entire nineteenth century.

Here in Eureka it seems that there was abundant rainfall on January 20, 1856, with temperatures hovering somewhere in the mid-to-low thirties (degrees Fahrenheit). Overnight conditions changed as an Arctic front moved across the region with temperatures plunging as much as fifty degrees (or perhaps more) within a twenty-four hour period. Some unofficial accounts suggest that the temperature on January 21 may have been in the minus thirties (degrees Fahrenheit) range in Eureka, and we can only speculate on what the wind chill might have been.

Benjamin Radford, Jr., who was sixteen years old at the time, remembered the event vividly. In a newspaper account that he wrote many years later, Radford commented about the effects of this dramatic temperature change. Radford stated that within the community there were hundreds of chicken that died because of the dramatic cold snap, and he mentions specifically that many of them died with their feet frozen to the ground.

On <strong>January 22, 1928</strong>, ceremonies were held on this date to mark the dedication of Magdalene Hall (today known as Gunzenhauser Hall). The new residence hall had been created through a generous gift from George Gunzenhauser of Batavia, Illinois, a Trustee of Eureka College from 1925-1931. The facility was constructed at a cost of $71,000.

The building was named "Magdalene" in honor of Gunzenhauser's recently-deceased daughter who had died in 1925 when she was a freshman at Eureka College. Appropriately, an angel adorns the frieze above the front entrance to this campus residence hall. An inscribed plaque over the parlor fireplace describes the building as "a memorial to the lovable disposition, the Christian character, and the missionary spirit" of Magdalene.

Though the structure is largely conservative and somewhat nondescript in its styling - perhaps to accentuate the understanding that it was a memorial to recognize a recent loss - the structure does contain a few significant features. The front portico is almost identical to that which is found on Burrus Dickinson Hall&mdash;even to the point of including the "rising sun" motif which could well have religious significance here. The circular "portals" that are found on the front and the rear of the building represent a dignified use of geometric Art Deco images that were characteristic of much 1920s architecture.

<article class="small-12 large-4 columns clearfix"> ![Stephen B. Binkley]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/profile-sBinkley-web.jpg "Stephen B. Binkley")<p class="caption">Stephen B. Binkley</p></article>

Stephen B. Binkley was born <strong>January 24, 1910</strong>. Binkley was a summa cum laude graduate of Eureka College, class of 1934. He did subsequent graduate work at the University of Nebraska where he earned his M.S. degree ('35) and the Ph.D. ('38). Binkley married fellow Eureka College alumnus Lois Grosse, Class of 1934, in 1934.

Dr. Binkley was a noted chemist who spent his career engaged in both research and teaching through his work both in private industry and in higher education. He worked as a research chemist for Parke Davis & Co. (1938&ndash;39) and later as the director of chemical research for Bristol Laboratories (1945&ndash;49). Professor Binkley taught at the St. Louis University College of Medicine (1938&ndash;41) and at the University of Illinois College of Medicine (1949&ndash;72).

In his capacity as a research chemist, Dr. Binkley had an opportunity to be a part of the research team that discovered Vitamin K and Folic acid. Dr. Edward A. Doisy, who headed the research team, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1943 for his work in the discovery of Vitamin K.

Dr. Binkley served Eureka College as a Trustee for several terms, including a stint as Chair of the Board of Trustees from 1964&ndash;69. He joined the Eureka College faculty in 1972 and taught until 1986. Under his leadership, the Chemistry labs in Vennum Science Hall were renovated in 1979 through the generous financial assistance of a grant provided by Caterpillar, Inc. In 1984, Eureka College renamed Vennum Science Hall as Vennum-Binkley Science Hall in honor of Stephen B. and Lois Grosse Binkley.
