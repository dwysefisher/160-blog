It was on <strong>November 16, 1928</strong>, that the famous midnight Chapel meeting was held that eventually led to a student strike. It was at that meeting that a freshman from Dixon, Illinois&mdash;"Dutch" Reagan&mdash;gave a pro-strike speech that swayed the gathered crowd to commit to that course of action.

The background for the student unrest was personified in Eureka College President Bert Wilson. Due to economic pressures, the College was considering a reduction in its academic offerings including the elimination of certain majors and the dropping of selected courses. Student leaders, primarily among the upperclassmen, decided that they would not stand for such action to be taken without a fight. John Leslie Pierce (Class of 1930) who was the President of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, was recognized by many as the leader of the student movement. It was Pierce who convinced Reagan that he should speak at the midnight meeting held at the Chapel.

While it might seem noble that the student body was so enraged by the thought of changes that might weaken the academic rigor of the institution, there seems to be another&mdash;perhaps "revisionist"&mdash;interpretation of events. President Wilson had angered many of the upperclassmen in previous years when he adamantly opposed student requests to allow supervised dances on the Eureka College campus. Just two years earlier, President Wilson had predicted that the chance of dances on the campus was rather unlikely in say the next sixty years or so. Within less than two years, Wilson was forced to revise his estimate downward when he announced that dances would be permitted on the campus. The actions taken at the midnight Chapel meeting may have been inspired as much by student dances as by the academic integrity of the institution.

After a voice vote was taken at the Chapel meeting, student leaders announced their intention to strike if their demands were not met. When the administration refused to consider the petition that was submitted by the students, a five-day strike resulted at the end of November 1928. The action led to the resignation of President Bert Wilson. The academic programs were not cut.

Many years later, Reagan later said in interviews that it was on that night at Eureka College that he first realized his ability to sway people with his words. In his view, his "political" sense was born at that time and in that place by leading the student action. The words that were spoken that evening were not recorded, but the outcome of the meeting has become a part of campus history and folklore.

A memorable cultural event took place on <strong>November 19, 1992</strong> when the Vienna Boy's Choir performed at Eureka College as a part of the group's North American Tour. The concert was one of the events sponsored as part of the College's Arts and Lecture Series for 1992&ndash;93.

Special concert-style floor seating was arranged for the event as a crowd of 1200 attended the performance that was held in the Reagan Center. The success of this program demonstrated the value of the newly-inaugurated Arts and Lecture Series. The audience for the concert included students, faculty, staff, and local community members, but many individuals traveled from towns throughout central Illinois to attend the concert.

The <a href="http://www.wctu.org/">Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU)</a> was founded on <strong>November 20, 1874</strong>, in Cleveland, Ohio. Representatives from the community of Eureka, Illinois, were present at the event. Both the community and the College produced leaders who took an active role in the temperance movement.

Eureka, Illinois, formed the first chapter of the WCTU in the state of Illinois shortly after the national organization was established. Frances Willard, who was one of the group's founders and a long-time president, visited the community of Eureka on several occasions and spoke at the Christian Church and at the College.
