It was on <strong>January 11, 1894</strong>, that fire destroyed the original Lida's Wood residence hall on the Eureka College campus. The College had been using this facility as a residence hall for women since it was acquired in 1888. Within a year of the 1894 fire facility was rebuilt.

The original home that formed what came to be known as Lida's Wood was constructed in 1869 by a Metamora attorney named R.T. Cassell who built a home in Eureka so that his daughters could attend Eureka College. Because of the family's surname and the size of the home that was constructed, the home became known as "The Castle" among local residents. The Cassell family sold the home to the Wallace J. Ford family in the early 1880s.

Wallace J. Ford had served as secretary to recently-assassinated President James A. Garfield. The Ford family moved from Ohio to Eureka and lived in the community for about seven years or so. In 1887, Lida Ford, the youngest child and only daughter of the Fords died. The following year, the Ford family offered its home to the College under the condition that it be used as a residence hall for women, that it be enlarged to suit such a purpose, and that it bear Lida's name.

Also on this date in <strong>1939</strong> the faculty of Eureka College approved of the Intensive Study Plan. It was later approved by the Board of Trustees, and the system went into effect at the start of the 1939&ndash;40 school year. The faculty of the College had been considering implementation of a unique curriculum for nearly a year, and the faculty and trustees eventually settled upon a model that was being used at Hiram College in Ohio. This system consisted of two elements: the use of terms and the concept of concentrated study.

According to this plan, most students took only one course of study during a term that lasted for nine weeks of instruction. Most of the classes that were offered at Eureka College under this plan were considered to be eight hour courses that met five days of the week, Monday through Friday. Some six hour courses were offered and these did not meet on Mondays. As a result, there were also some two hour courses that were offered only on Mondays, and these were usually paired with six hour courses that students might be taking at the time. Thus, no student would be taking more than two courses (for a combination of eight hours) during any term. This system remained in place until it was modified in 1954.

On <strong>January 12, 1956</strong>, a United Fund was established for the Eureka community. Still existing today as the [Eureka Area United Fund](http://www.eurekaareaunitedfund.org/), this organization conducts an annual campaign in the communities of Eureka, Goodfield, Congerville, and Secor to raise funds that help to support more than thirty service organizations and groups in the region.

American artist Edna Hibel was born on <strong>January 13, 1917</strong>. Many items of Hibel's artwork grace the Eureka College campus having been presented as gifts to the college. In 1995, Edna Hibel was the speaker at commencement at which time she received an honorary degree from Eureka College.

It was also on this date in <strong>1993</strong>, during the final days of the administration of President George Bush, that former president Ronald W. Reagan (Class of 1932) was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This award, which was first established in 1963, is America's highest civilian honor.

It was on <strong>January 14, 1893</strong>, that the decision was made to put a gymnasium facility into Recitation Hall [also known as the Administration Building and today known as Burrus Dickinson Hall]. In order to do this, the flooring on the east side of the building on the third floor level was removed. As a result of this, what is now the Education Division suite ceased to exist and the flooring of what is now the Development Office became the College's official athletic hardwood.

Several factors can be viewed as contributing to this decision. In the United States there was a growing notion of leisure time that had resulted from rapid industrialization in previous decades. Much of this development can be traced by the associated growth of organized sporting events during this period. In fact, new games like basketball were being created (1891) at this period. Also, at Eureka College, a new academic building&mdash;Burgess Memorial Hall&mdash;had just been completed and was first used in the 1892&ndash;93 school year. With the luxury of having additional classroom space and the perceived need of providing an area for year-round training in athletics and calisthenics, the College decided to make the modifications to Recitation Hall.

From the time that the decision was made in 1893 until the time that Pritchard Gymnasium was completed in 1915, the makeshift gymnasium that existed in Recitation Hall was the only indoor athletic facility found on the campus. During this period (1893&ndash;1915) the Board of Trustees did acquire property adjacent to the college that was developed into an Athletic Park.

On <strong>January 15, 1820</strong>, Ben Major married Lucy Davenport in Kentucky. This was the second time that these two families were joined by marriage as William Davenport and Eliza Major had been married in Christian County, Kentucky, just five months earlier. These marriages joined two families&mdash;the Davenports and the Majors&mdash;that would later play a significant role in the settlement of Walnut Grove [later Eureka] in what eventually became Woodford County, Illinois. The familiar names Davenport and Major adorn school buildings, college residence halls, and street signs in this community making them an ever present force in this town. A walk through Eureka's Olio Cemetery reveals how significant these two families were in the formation of this community as these early settlers and many of their progeny are buried there. Descendants of these families still live in Eureka and surrounding communities.

On <strong>January 16, 1933</strong>, the Cooperative Education Plan (also called the Eureka Plan) was announced. Seven weeks before Franklin Delano Roosevelt became President of the United States, Eureka College announced its own version of a "New Deal" to permit cash-strapped students to continue attending the institution during the depths of the Great Depression. Through the Cooperative Education Plan students were able to work for the college with the wages that they earned being applied to covering the costs of tuition and room and board. In very many respects, the program was an early version of the work-study concept that would eventually become adopted nationwide as a part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society reforms of the 1960s.

The Eureka Plan was completely organized and operated by students who ran the program with their own administrative hierarchy that functioned with seemingly military precision. The program was quite successful and it garnered attention from many quarters. Though many small colleges were ruined by the Great Depression, Eureka College found a way to "muddle through" and survive the extended economic downturn. Later in the 1930s, when historians/authors working for the Federal Writers' Project (a WPA program) prepared Illinois: A Descriptive and Historical Guide they included the comment "In 1933 Eureka College inaugurated the Eureka Plan, which affords students part-time jobs to pay for their tuition and board" in their description of the town.

Abisha M. Myers died on <strong>January 17, 1872</strong>. Abisha and his brother Elias B. Myers supported Eureka College in various capacities during its early years. Elias B. Myers was listed on the charter of the College as being an original trustee - records indicate his service in this capacity only in 1855. Abisha M. Myers served on the Board of Trustees from 1855-1870. Interestingly enough, Myers Hall, one of the residence halls in the Founders' Court complex is named after Elias B. Myers. But what about Abisha?

Abisha M. Myers was a successful businessman in the Walnut Grove (Eureka) community. At the time that the College was founded, he owned and operated the community's first hotel and this business establishment included the town's first saloon. Of the two Myers brothers, the elder brother Elias owned 8000 acres while Abisha owned only 400 acres of property plus his business ventures in town. Fifteen of the acres owned by Elias became the original campus of Eureka College.

In 1857 the Founders of Eureka College were engaged in a capital campaign to raise $60,000 that would be used to construct Recitation Hall [the current administration building, Burrus Dickinson Hall] and to build the College's endowment for a sound financial future. Pledges for the drive had been received and construction of Recitation Hall had begun when the financial Panic of 1857 struck, almost without warning. Individuals who had made pledges to the College were unable to honor their commitments, and it seemed for a time, that the newly-founded institution might not survive.

Eureka College was saved through the heroic efforts of three individuals: John Darst, and the brothers Elias and Abisha Myers. Each of these individuals mortgaged their personal property to the maximum dollar amount allowed so that the construction of Recitation Hall could be completed and the College could flourish. Abisha M. Myers, who owned the first saloon in Eureka, may have had more than just a passing interest in the success of the institution.

When the actual recruiting of Company G of the 17th Illinois Infantry took place in April 1861, the local volunteers were mustered into service at Myers' Hotel. Yes, there was a gathering that took place neath the "Recruiting Elm," but the actual recruiting took place elsewhere.

Incidentally, the Myers family was quite well known in the Walnut Grove (Eureka) community. Both adults and children of the Myers clan were considered to be somewhat reckless individuals who always seemed to take a devil-may-care attitude toward life. One of the local truisms in the early community of Walnut Grove (Eureka) was the popular saying "You can't kill a Myers."
