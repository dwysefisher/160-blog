On May 4, 1867, Elias B. Myers died. A founder of Eureka College, Myers served on the Board of Trustees of the college and served as treasurer of the institution from its founding in 1855 until the time of his death. He is remembered today by having a building in the Founders' Court residence hall complex named in his honor.

Additionally, one of Elias Myers' sons&mdash;Henry H. Myers&mdash;was one of the students who joined Company G of the 17th Illinois Infantry. Henry Myers was the first of the Eureka College student-soldiers to die during the Civil War.

On May 5, 1876, David Deweese died. Deweese was among the founders of Eureka College who is remembered today by having one of the buildings in the Founder's Court residence hall complex named in his honor.

It had been Deweese, along with Ben Major and Elias Myers, who pledged $150 each in 1849 to establish the Walnut Grove Academy (the successor to the Walnut Grove Seminary). That expansion of facilities would eventually grow into Eureka College by 1855.

President Reagan used the opportunity to make a significant foreign policy speech in advance of an upcoming trip to Europe. It was during this speech that President Reagan outlined the START initiative - Strategic Arms Reduction Talks - as an alternative to the SALT approach that had been begun in the 1970s. Some have hailed this speech as the beginning of the end of the Cold War.

Later, on the same day in 1982, President Reagan was inducted into the Eureka College Athletic Hall of Fame.
