---

On June 26, 1913, woman's suffrage in Illinois was enacted by state law. In taking this action, Illinois became the first state east of the Mississippi River to grant the right to vote to women.

From the time of its founding, Eureka College had advocated equality of opportunity for women, and many of the individuals associated with the institution (both women and men) had been tireless foot soldiers in the campaign for women's rights in America. Here are a few of the school's highlights in the area of women's rights.

Founded just two months after the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, the Walnut Grove Seminary in Walnut Grove/Eureka opened its doors to women as well as to men.

When Eureka College was founded in 1855, it became the first institution in Illinois and only the third in the nation to admit women on an equal basis with men. Only Oberlin in Ohio and Hillsdale in Michigan had acted earlier in this regard.

Early speakers at Eureka College included Horace Mann, Susan B. Anthony and Frances Willard, all noted reformers who advocated equal rights for women.

The earliest chapter of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union established in the state of Illinois was founded in the community of Eureka in 1874.

That same year (1874) three Eureka College women - Elmira Dickinson, Caroline Neville Pearre and Nancy J. Ledgerwood Burgess established the Christian Women's Board of Missions.

In 1880, former Eureka College student Erasmus Correll introduced the first legislative effort to grant women the right to vote in the history of the United States. This was done in the state of Nebraska where Correll served in that state's legislature. The following year, he was elected president of the American Woman's Suffrage Association.

Eliza Seass Stewart, Class of 1890, became a national officer in the National American Woman Suffrage Association and was actively involved in the Illinois campaign in 1913.

Jane K. Rooker Breeden, the wife of James Knox Breeden, Class of 1871, led the movement in South Dakota for women to acquire the suffrage.

Former Eureka College faculty member Emma Smith DeVoe was instrumental in winning the right to vote for women in the state of Washington in 1910. Her efforts revitalized the national campaign for woman's suffrage. DeVoe was recently inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y.

Based upon the heroic actions of all these daughters and sons of Eureka College and the many unsung supporters who lent their support to the cause of women's rights, Eureka College has the right to commemorate the actions of Illinois that took place in June 1913.
