On May 14, 1877, Elder John T. Jones died. Even before the Walnut Grove Seminary came into existence in 1848, there had been a brief
effort to establish a school for girls in the community of Walnut Grove. This log-cabin schoolhouse was begun by John T. Jones along with his wife, Emily, and their daughter, Susan, and it seems to have operated for only one year, at the most. Fifteen girls were enrolled at the school in fall 1847. The school likely went out of business due to a lack of enrollment that was partly caused by a measles epidemic that hit the community in spring 1848.

John T. Jones was an elder in the Christian Church that was established in the community of Walnut Grove. Like many of the other founding families of the community, he and his family had immigrated to central Illinois from their home in Christian County, Ken., in the mid-1830s. The school for girls that Jones established was built adjacent to his home, and it was located about one block north of what is now Olio Township Cemetery.

On May 12, 1902, Eureka College lost a true friend and benefactor upon the death of Nancy J. Ledgerwood Burgess. The wife of professor Otis Asa Burgess, "Nannie" Burgess had endowed the college with a gift of property estimated at $10,000 to finance the construction of a building to honor her husband. Burgess Memorial Hall resulted from that gift.

Mrs. Burgess was also instrumental in the formation of the Christian Women's Board of Missions (CWBM), which she helped to organize in 1874. Burgess, along with Elmira Dickinson and Caroline Neville Peare, created the CWBM in Eureka, and eventually this organization had a national and international following. Because all of the founders of the CWBM were women who had connections to Eureka College, the organization had a very strong following within the college. Many graduates of Eureka College served within either the home or foreign missions.

The gravesites of Nancy J. Ledgerwood Burgess and Otis Asa Burgess are located in Forrest, Ill.

Upon his retirement from the college, Dickinson was for many years the editor of the Woodford County Journal. Dickinson was a local historian who wrote a book on the history of the city of Eureka. Today, the academic building on campus that was once known as Recitation Hall, and later as the Administration Building, is named Burrus Dickinson Hall.
