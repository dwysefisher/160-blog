Elmira Jane Dickinson died on April 1, 1912. She was certainly one of the most remarkable women associated with the history of Eureka College. In 1874 Dickinson, along with Caroline Pearre and Nancy J. Ledgerwood Burgess, helped to found the Christian Women's Board of Missions. Within a few years, this organization became one of the largest organizations in the world supporting the work of missionaries both foreign and domestic. In 1887 Dickinson became the first woman appointed to the Board of Trustees of Eureka College. She served in that capacity from 1887 to 1899. Within five years after she was appointed to the board, there were four women serving as trustees. She became the first official historian of Eureka College when she wrote "A History of Eureka College with Biographical Sketches and Reminiscences," published in 1894. Those who chronicle the institution today are indebted to the work that she did in this pioneering study.

On April 2, 1937, Warner Brothers offered an acting contract to Ronald Reagan, Eureka College class of 1932. Reagan, who was then working as a sports announcer for Des Moines radio station WHO, had taken a screen test in Hollywood when he went to Los Angeles to follow spring training with the Chicago Cubs. Reagan signed the contract within a few weeks of receiving it. The contract covered a seven-year period and included a starting salary of $200 a week â€“ not bad by Depression era standards.

On April 4, 1994, Eureka College hosted a lecture by renowned science fiction author Ray Bradbury. He wrote the classics "Fahrenheit 451," "The Martian Chronicles," "The Illustrated Man," "Dandelion Wine," and "Something Wicked This Way Comes." He wrote the screenplay for John Huston's classic film adaptation of Moby Dick, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted 65 of his stories for television's "The Ray Bradbury Theater," and won an Emmy for his teleplay of "The Halloween Tree." He died in 2012.
