On June 12, 1987, speaking at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate within the shadow of the Berlin Wall, U.S. President Ronald Reagan issued the impassioned call, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."

Yet today a 2,200-pound chunk of that now-defunct symbol of Cold War tyranny stands amidst the splendor of flowers in the Reagan Peace Garden on the campus of Eureka College.
