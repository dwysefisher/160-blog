On <strong>October 25, 1913</strong>, Eureka College's football team played its first home game since 1901. The game was played in the Athletic Park that was adjacent to the campus. This hiatus in home games was partly due to the inadequate quality of facilities at the Athletic Park as well as the uncertainty of the future of intercollegiate athletics at Eureka College.

Renewed interest in football came with the appointment of Harry Otis Pritchard as president of the College in September 1913. In his previous appointment at Cotner College Pritchard had served as football coach along with his other many duties there.

Eureka College students in 1913 agreed to increase their tuition by $2.50 per semester to help finance athletics on campus. In addition, the student body had petitioned the Board of Trustees to hire a football coach with faculty status in order to ensure the school's commitment to intercollegiate athletics. In a cost-cutting measure in 1912, the Board of Trustees had eliminated the position of Coach.

On <strong>October 26, 1881</strong>, Erasmus M. Correll was elected as president of the American Woman Suffrage Association (A.W.S.A.). His name is likely not a familiar one, even to those knowledgeable of the history of Eureka College, but Correll may well be one of the most remarkable historical figures to be associated with the history of the College and of the nation.

Correll attended Eureka College for two years in the late-1860s, but he did not graduate from the College. He took advantage of the Homestead Act and moved westward by the lure of available lands eventually settling in Nebraska. By 1880, Correll was serving as a member of the Nebraska State Legislature.

In 1880 Correll introduced a measure in the lower house of the Nebraska legislature calling for the right to vote to be granted to women in that state. The measure passed in the lower house and was subsequently passed by the state senate. In 1880 the measure was placed before voters in Nebraska for their final decision on the question, but voters there defeated the measure. Correll's resolution was the first such measure within a state to advocate the issue of women's suffrage. [Note: In the territory of Wyoming, suffrage had been granted in 1869.] Even though Nebraska voters defeated the measure in a referendum, Correll's efforts were so remarkable to the cause of women's suffrage that the A.W.S.A. honored the young legislator the following year by making him the president of their national organization.

On <strong>October 27, 1964</strong>, Ronald W. Reagan gave the nationally-televised speech "A Time for Choosing" in support of the presidential candidacy of Senator Barry Goldwater, the Republican Party's standard bearer in the race against incumbent president Lyndon Baines Johnson. Although Goldwater lost the 1964 contest, the speech certainly launched the future political career of Reagan. To many among the Reagan faithful, the 1964 address is known simply as "The Speech" - an impressive designation indeed. "The Speech" also ranks - until today - in another historical regard. No other single televised address in American political history has ever generated the amount of spontaneous campaign contributions that were generated by Reagan's address on that October evening in 1964.

Perhaps "The Speech" of 1964 marked the passing of the conservative mantle from Barry Goldwater to Ronald Reagan. Certainly subsequent events might bear out such an interpretation of events. In the Reagan Exhibit in the Cerf College Center there is an interesting item, it is a small, chevron-shaped plaque that bears the following inscription: "To Ronald Reagan - In appreciation for your efforts and devotion to the candidacy of Barry Goldwater for President of the United States." That small item may indeed represent an important turning point in American political history.

On <strong>October 27, 1965</strong>, Clinton and Wesley Melick donated $200,000 to help fund the construction of a new library at Eureka College. The library, that would be completed by September 1967, would be named Melick Library in honor of the generous support provided by the Melick brothers.

On <strong>October 28, 1985</strong>, the first public lecture was sponsored by the Eureka Peace Issues Council (EPIC). This community organization included Eureka College faculty, staff, students, alumni, and other community members who were concerned about the state of world affairs in the mid-1980s. Peace initiatives, discussions regarding nuclear nonproliferation, sustainable development, environmental awareness, and other social justice concerns were topics that received attention in forums that were sponsored by EPIC.

On <strong>October 31, 1796</strong>, Ben Major was born. Ben Major was one of the primary founders of the Walnut Grove Seminary and the Walnut Grove Academy. In 1851, he spoke the prophetic words "On that rise we intend to build a college." Unfortunately, Major died the following year of Asiatic cholera and was not able to witness the day when his dream - Eureka College - would become a reality.
