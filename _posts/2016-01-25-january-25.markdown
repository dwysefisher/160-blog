Elijah Dickinson was born on <strong>January 26, 1795</strong>, in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. As a teenager, Dickinson served his nation as a soldier during the War of 1812. He moved to Hopkinsville, Kentucky, in 1817, and married Mary Ann Burrus in 1819.

In 1834, he along with a few of his neighbors from Christian County, Kentucky, made a reconnaissance trip on horseback through the central part of Illinois. The following year, Dickinson, along with many of the neighboring Kentucky families, relocated to Illinois in October 1835 as pioneer settlers in the community of Walnut Grove.

Dickinson became the patriarch of the early Walnut Grove settlement. He was known as "Uncle Lijah" to most of the young people of the community. It seems that Dickinson was one of the individuals who was responsible for preserving the Kentucky tradition of cooking burgoo ["the feast of boiled offerings"] at community gatherings. These community festivities, often held near the Old Spring during the summer, formed an integral part of the cultural and social life of the Walnut Grove community.

Elijah Dickinson was one of the Founding Trustees of Eureka College and he served as the first president of the Board of Trustees from 1855 until his death in 1862.

On this date in <strong>January 27, 1988</strong>, the faculty of Eureka College dropped the requirement that all students completing a degree must earn a minor.

On <strong>January 28, 1856</strong>, the Excelsior Society was founded at Eureka College. This organization was created as a society to promote literary and social culture for women. In previous years, male students had formed three groups&mdash;the Edmund Burke, Periclesian and Mathesian Societies&mdash;which had similar goals. The Excelsior Society continued to exist until in later years the Edmund Burke and Periclesian Societies declared women eligible for membership.

At the time that this society was founded female students constituted approximately forty percent of the enrollment at Eureka College. Women accounted for one-third of all the graduates of Eureka College in the nineteenth century.

Emma Smith and John Henry DeVoe were married on <strong>January 30, 1880</strong>. Emma Smith had formerly been a faculty member in the Music Department at Eureka College. John Henry DeVoe was a lawyer who worked for the railroads. After their marriage, the DeVoes moved west to Washington State.

Emma Smith DeVoe began a new life in the west by becoming involved in the women's suffrage movement. She worked tirelessly to help women in Idaho and Washington State earn the right to vote. She also founded the national group that came to be known as the League of Women Voters.

In October 2000, Emma Smith DeVoe was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.

On <strong>January 31, 1991</strong>, a referendum was held on campus to determine the fate of the Red Devil as mascot of Eureka College. By a vote of 183 to 27 the student body voted to keep the Red Devil as mascot.

The referendum stemmed from discussions that had been held earlier in the 1990-91 school year questioning whether or not it was appropriate for a church-related institution to have a devil as its mascot. The issue was also connected to the historical (or purist) view that the Red Devil had not always been the mascot at Eureka College, but had become the school's mascot sometime during the 1920s/1930s.

Originally, the athletic teams that were fielded by Eureka College were known as the Golden Tornadoes. Sometime in the 1920s the name "Red Devils" was first used, and it seems that there was a time when both names/mascots were used simultaneously.

In 1992, Madge Henrich (class of 1925) provided her own explanation of her involvement with the name's origin:

 <div class="panel">
  <p>It was in mid-January 1925 when the Eureka College basketball team went to Illinois Wesleyan in Bloomington to play a game. A group of us girls went to Bloomington to see the game.</p>

  <p>The playing floor was crowded, so we went upstairs to watch the game. The team was warming up and they were wearing their bright red uniforms. Coach &lsquo;Mac&rsquo; McKinzie always had the team warm up in an unusual way&mdash;putting their arms around each other and jumping around in a circle.</p>

  <p>As we watched them, somehow it occurred to me to say, &ldquo;They look just like little red devils!&rdquo; The girls agreed with me and said I should suggest that name in the contest that was being conducted by the <em>Pegasus</em>, our school newspaper.</p>

  <p>I thought about it for a few days, but the girls had been so insistent that I did decide to submit it in the contest. So I sent in the name &lsquo;Mac&rsquo;s Red Devils.&rsquo; I was so surprised when the contest was over that I was declared the winner and received the prize of $5.</p>

  <p>I had no idea that the name &lsquo;Devils&rsquo; would cause so much criticism. Everyone on the campus seemed to understand why I used the word &lsquo;devils.&rsquo; It was simply the color of their uniforms, and certainly not their character, that made me think of the &lsquo;devils.&rsquo;</p>

In the Spring 2008 edition of <em>Maroon &amp; Gold</em>, Chaplain Bruce Fowlkes compiled some background on "The Evolution of the Eureka Mascot," revisited here.

From 1925, when the Red Devil mascot first appeared, through 1983, the Eureka mascot went through several incarnations. For the first two decades, "Red Devils" was the nickname of the men's basketball team only, and it was inspired by the back-to-back championship seasons of Coach McKinzie. The team was also called "Mac's Red Devils," "McKinziemen," "Macmen," "Mac's Five," "Cagers," and "The Christians." Perhaps the best way to characterize the sentiment surrounding the advent of the Red Devil is "Christians who fight like the Devil."

During this period, the football team's nickname was the Golden Tornadoes, and the 'mascots' were simply little boys. By the time Ronald Reagan visited the campus as an alum in the mid-1940s, the Red Devil name had transferred to football. But the nickname wasn't applied to other sports across the board until much later. In the 1970s, many variations on the name popped up: "Lady Red Devils" and "Aqua Devils," to name a few.

By 1957, the yearbook reveals that the Red Devil image was thrown around as a fun, cartoonish image, but the actual image appeared very rarely in yearbooks from this time. And the Red Devil wasn't a marketing image until after 1983.
