<p class="caption">Quote by Samuel Harrod, class of 1903, born on this date in 1882.</p>

Samuel Glenn Harrod (Class of 1903) was born on <strong>January 5, 1882</strong>. After graduating from Eureka College, Harrod was a professor at the College from 1909-43. He was Dean of the Faculty from 1923-26 and Dean of the College from 1936-43.

Many of Dean Harrod's speeches on campus and in the larger community often ended with a mantra that he coined: "Eureka College: Many larger, few smaller, none better."

It was on <strong>January 5, 1899</strong>, that William A. Poynter (Class of 1867) was inaugurated as Governor of Nebraska. He served one two-year term from 1899&ndash;1901. During his inaugural address, Governor Poynter said, "We recognize that the primary power rests in the hands of the people and that this, their will, should at all times be considered supreme. Partisanship may be bitter before election, but the will of the people having been expressed, citizenship should rise above partisanship. It is my most sincere desire that we shall cooperate for the best interests of the state." He died in 1909.

It was on this date in <strong>1906</strong> that Frank Frantz was inaugurated as Governor of the Oklahoma Territory. Frantz was a native of Roanoke, Illinois, and he studied for two years at Eureka College during the 1880s. In 1898 he served in Cuba during the Spanish-American War as a member of the famed Rough Riders who were organized by Colonel Theodore Roosevelt.

Frantz was the last Territorial Governor of Oklahoma. He was defeated in an attempt to run for Governor once Oklahoma became a state. During that campaign, Frantz was the target in a failed assassination attempt. He retired from political life and became involved in a successful career in the oil business. He died in Tulsa in 1941.

It was on this date in <strong>1967</strong> that Ronald W. Reagan (Class of 1932) was inaugurated as Governor of California. Reagan would go on to serve two terms as governor of that state (1967-75), and later became the fortieth President of the United States (1981&ndash;89).

It was on this date in 1851 that classes were first held at the Walnut Grove Academy located in Walnut Grove (later Eureka), Illinois. The classes were held in the newly-constructed Walnut Grove Academy Building, sometimes called Darst's Hall, that had been built to accommodate the growing enrollment at the Walnut Grove Seminary.

The Walnut Grove Academy building was likely the first permanent, brick structure constructed in the community of Walnut Grove. It stood at the present-day site of the Rinker bungalow on the western end of the campus. The building was a two-story red brick structure built in the frontier rustic style, and it measured thirty-by-forty feet in dimensions. The bottom floor of the building housed the Chapel which was used both as classroom space and as a community meeting house. The second floor of the building housed two seminar rooms and a ten-by-ten foot room that housed the first library.

The Walnut Grove Academy building was used as an academic building even after Eureka College was founded in 1855. It is likely that the building stood until the early 1880s when the site was razed to construct a residence hall known as Gentleman's Hall No. 2.

The Walnut Grove Academy building was a historic structure in many ways. The building was the center of the cultural life of the early Walnut Grove (later Eureka) community. It was here that Abraham Lincoln spoke when he visited the campus in October 1856. Other notable visitors who spoke in the Chapel at the Walnut Grove Academy included suffragette Susan B. Anthony, WCTU leader Frances Willard, educational reformer Horace Mann, Christian Church co-founder Alexander Campbell, abolitionist Congressman Owen Lovejoy, Methodist evangelist Peter Cartwright, and Col. John Sobieski, the heir to the throne of Poland.

It was on <strong>January 8, 1990</strong>, that former President Ronald W. Reagan (Class of 1932) received the prestigious Theodore Roosevelt Award from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). [The award, affectionately called the "Teddy,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_Award) is presented annually to a distinguished citizen who holds the distinction of being a former college athlete. The "Teddy" award is the highest individual honor the NCAA may confer.

Named after President Theodore Roosevelt, whose concern for the conduct of intercollegiate athletics led to the formation of the NCAA in 1906, this annual award is given to an individual "for whom competitive athletics in college and attention to physical well-being thereafter have been important factors in a distinguished career of national significance and achievement." More specifically, the NCAA has established the following criteria:

"The Theodore Roosevelt Award shall be presented annually to a distinguished citizen of national reputation and outstanding accomplishment who-having earned a varsity athletics award in college-has by a continuing interest and concern for physical fitness and competitive sport and by personal example exemplified most clearly and forcefully the ideals and purposes to which collegiate athletics programs and amateur sports competition are dedicated."

The "Teddy" that President Reagan received in 1990 is permanently displayed in the Reagan Exhibit housed in the Cerf College Center on the Eureka College campus.

It was on <strong>January 9, 1990</strong>, that the Student Foundation was chartered at Eureka College. This organization, a completely student-run body, has worked now for more than a decade to raise monies that are used to provide scholarships for students who attend Eureka College.

This noble service effort which highlights the notion of students helping students, has been able to provide on average ten to twelve limited stipends per year to assist students who are in financial need. Monies raised for this cause have come from the effort of Student Foundation members who work at concession stands for Eureka College sporting events. From time to time the group has also sponsored other fund-raising activities.

The scholarships that are provided through the efforts of the Student Foundation are presented each year at the Honor's Night ceremony held in the latter part of spring semester. Through the altruism of caring service, the members of the Student Foundation recognize the value of a Eureka College education and give of their own time and energy to make sure that others are able to continue in their academic efforts. We describe this institution in terms of its commitment to learning, service, and leadership, and it is likely that the Student Foundation is one of the best examples of an entity of the College that is representative of all of these attributes.

It was on <strong>January 10, 1899</strong> that Fire Company No. 1 was formally organized in the town of Eureka. Some social and urban historians suggest that the formation of such community fire companies is one way to mark the transition between the founding stage in community development and a more permanent state of community viability.

Harvey Marion Trimble died on this date in 1918. Most of you will likely not recognize Trimble's name, yet he was likely the first individual associated with Eureka College to become a nationally known figure.

Trimble was a student at Eureka College when the Civil War began in 1861. He quit his college studies to join the army and he fought in the 93rd Illinois Infantry during the war. In the years following the Civil War, Trimble was actively involved in causes related to veterans' affairs for members of the Union army, and he was instrumental in organizing the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), the veterans' organization that was organized initially in Illinois in the spring of 1866.

Trimble served as the leader of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1911-1918. The period of his leadership coincided with the fiftieth anniversary (1911-15) of the Civil War, and as a result, Trimble was involved in commemorative events that were held around the nation at that time.

It was also on this date in <strong>1928</strong> that Eureka College President Bert Wilson announced that supervised dances would be allowed on the campus. This was a major two-step for an individual who in 1924 had predicted that dances would probably not take place on the campus in his lifetime. In many respects, the controversy over dancing on campus would lead in part to the student strike that took place in the fall of 1928 and led to the resignation of Wilson.

Also on this date in <strong>1980</strong> Fred E. Magel, the self-proclaimed "world's dining out expert" visited the town of Eureka where he had meal number 42,640. Magel, a food critic from Chicago, is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as holding the dining out record with 46,000 meals in sixty countries over a fifty year career. Now you may find this hard to swallow, but at that rate, Magel averaged 2.5 dining out experiences per day over his career as a food critic.
