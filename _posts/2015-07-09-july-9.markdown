On <strong>July 9, 1797</strong>, noted British statesman Edmund Burke died. Later, when the young men attending Walnut Grove Academy decided to form a literary society that would encourage spirited debate and intellectual alacrity, they named their organization the Edmund Burke Society. Literary societies such as the Edmund Burke Society, the Malthusian Society and the Periclesian Society existed at the campus until the early part of the 20th century when such organizations were replaced by fraternities and sororities.

One of Edmund Burke's most often quoted maxims: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."

On <strong>July 8, 1858</strong>, The Washington Investigator carried a brief notice that described the construction of Recitation Hall at Eureka College. The construction of the three-story brick structure that is today known as Burrus Dickinson Hall [formerly the Administration Building] was a significant event in the early life of Eureka College. For many years, that single building was Eureka College. It housed nearly every office and classroom that was necessary for the institution's operation.

On <strong>July 10, 1876</strong>, Harry Otis Pritchard was born. He served as president of Eureka College from 1913&ndash;1919, and as a human dynamo, his tenure was associated with an expansive building program that energized the campus at multiple levels. Pritchard Gymnasium [now Pritchard Fine Arts Center] and Vennum Science Hall [now Vennum-Binkley Hall] were constructed on the campus during the administration of President Pritchard.

Pritchard was a native of Johnson County, Indiana. He earned his A.B. at Butler College (1902), his A.M. at the University of Indianapolis (1903), and his B.D. from Yale University (1906).

Prior to his appointment at Eureka College, Pritchard had served as pastor at Cotner College in Bethany, Nebraska, from 1907&ndash;13 (his other responsibilities there included coaching football and the debate teams). He served as president at Eureka College for six years, and upon leaving that position, World Call noted his legacy in that "practically a new physical plant has been built, endowment largely increased, college attendance advanced 300 per cent, and academic standing lifted to the first rank among Illinois schools." When he left Eureka in 1919, Pritchard took the position of General Secretary for the National Board of Education for the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), a position he held until the time of his death.
