The Berlin Wall was opened on <strong>November 9, 1989</strong>, marking the symbolic ending of the Cold War. Today a portion of that wall, which for nearly three decades represented the barrier between freedom and tyranny, now stands in the Reagan Peace Garden at Eureka College. Eureka is one of only three colleges/universities in the United States to have received a gift of the Berlin Wall from the Federal Republic of Germany.

The first homecoming game in the history of Eureka College took place on <strong>November 11, 1922</strong>. Eureka College lost 12-0 to Illinois College in a difficult game that was played in the rain. The tradition of football homecoming games at Eureka College has continued since that time except for a brief hiatus during the Second World War when the college was unable to maintain a football team due to low enrollment of male students. (For example, in 1943 Eureka had a total enrollment of 53 students and only 7 were male.)

A significant event in the life of Eureka College took place on <strong>November 12, 1926</strong>. Eureka College was first admitted to the Association of American Universities on this date, thereby gaining the recognition of being an accredited institution of higher education for the first time in its seventy-one year history. For many, accreditation was a landmark moment that affirmed the many years that had been devoted to growing the College's endowment and development of its facilities.

The coming of the Great Depression would be very unkind to Eureka College as it was to the nation. Extraordinary financial circumstances forced the College to streamline its academic program and spend a portion of its endowment, decisions that unfortunately caused the institution to lose accreditation on July 1, 1936. This event, perhaps the nadir of Eureka College history, caused the resignation of President Clyde L. Lyon. Eureka College was reaccredited twenty-six years later in 1962 when President Ira W. Langston led a sustained effort to regain accreditation.

It was also on <strong>November 12, 1974</strong>, that Emeritus Professor Jacob A. Rinker died. A product of Table Grove, Illinois, Rinker attended Eureka College and graduated in the Class of 1918. Rinker taught at Eureka College from 1919 until his retirement in 1957. Few individuals have had as much of a lasting impact upon the campus as did Prof. Rinker during his thirty-eight year teaching career at Eureka College.

The Eureka College Honors Program was first established on <strong>November 12, 1985</strong>. The program was one that Dean Gary E. Gammon had strongly advocated.

The program was created to recognize those Eureka College students who exemplified the highest standards in academic achievement. These students were placed into special sections of English composition and Western Civilization and Culture that would afford them more challenging opportunities. Additionally, those students who participated in the Honors Program would also take an Honors Seminar during their freshman, sophomore, and junior years. These special-topics courses would allow an opportunity for advanced reading and discussion of various issues. In the senior year, Honors Students would prepare an Honors Thesis that would be presented publicly in the spring of the student's graduating year.

The first Humbert Lecture was presented at Eureka College on <strong>November 13, 1975</strong>. The lecture series was established to honor Professor Royal Humbert who taught religion and philosophy at Eureka College for nearly three decades. The lecture series is designed to highlight religious and philosophical issues of the day and their confluence with public life. Professor Humbert presented the inaugural lecture for the series.
