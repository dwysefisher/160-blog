On <strong>December 7, 1928</strong>, the Board of Trustees of Eureka College officially accepted the resignation of Bert Wilson. President Wilson had submitted his resignation two weeks earlier, well before the student strike that took place in late-November 1928.

Also on this date in <strong>1990</strong>, the Eureka College community lost one of its giants with the passing of legendary coach Ralph McKinzie (Class of 1923). McKinzie had a long and illustrious career as a coach both at Eureka College and at Northern Illinois University. Both institutions today honor his memory in athletic contests that are played upon locations that are named McKinzie Field.

<p class="clearfix">On <strong>December 8, 1862</strong>, Robert Enoch Hieronymus (Class of 1889) was born on this date in 1862. Hieronymus would later teach at Eureka College for many years and he served as president of the institution from 1900-09. The house that is located at 711 Burgess Street, currently the President's Home, was built in the mid-1890s as the Hieronymus family residence.</p>

It was also on this date in <strong>1927</strong> that Rev. Kirby Page, an internationally renown pacifist, spoke upon the Eureka College campus. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Page">Rev. Page (1890-1957)</a> was a prominent anti-war activist and exponent of the Social Gospel, and a prolific speaker and writer. He worked for the YMCA and served as personal secretary to Sherwood Eddy for a few years. From 1926 to 1934, he was editor of World Tomorrow, a Christian pacifist monthly published in New York. In his career he wrote more than forty books and numerous articles.

Page had published a pamphlet entitled "War: Its Causes, Consequences and Cure" in 1923. A copy of this work was sent to Mohandas Gandhi in India who reproduced it in twenty-one installments in the publication Young India between November 26, 1925, and May 6, 1926. Just a few years later, Rev. Page traveled to India to meet with Gandhi. Page subsequently wrote about the experience in a booklet entitled "Is Mahatma Gandhi the Greatest Man of the Age?" Years later, in his own autobiography, Page answered his earlier question by writing "Long since that question mark has been erased from my mind."

On this date in <strong>1980</strong>, Dan Gilbert, the President of Eureka College, was named to the Transition Team that would organize the beginnings of Ronald W. Reagan's administration. During the next few months, President Gilbert divided his duties between work in Eureka and work in Washington so that a smooth and orderly transition of power would take place on January 20, 1981, when Ronald W. Reagan became the nation's fortieth president.

On <strong>December 9, 1778</strong>, during the American Revolution, the colony/state of Virginia annexed the County of Illinois. Through this action, the territory that now constitutes the state of Illinois was considered under the governance of Virginia until the region became a part of the "national domain" formed under the Articles of Confederation government at the end of the American Revolution.

In <strong>1970</strong>, ceremonies were held on the Eureka College campus to dedicate the Reagan Physical Education Center that was named in honor of Ronald and Neil Reagan, graduates of the College. The main speaker at the dedication ceremonies was Bob Pettit, the recently retired star of the St. Louis Hawks professional basketball franchise.

<p class="clearfix">On <strong>December 10</strong>, Asa Starbuck Fisher was born on this date in 1824. Twenty-three years later, when the Walnut Grove Seminary opened its doors in September 1848, it was Professor Fisher who became the first teacher at that institution.</p>

<p class="clearfix">It was on this date in <strong>1943</strong> that the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Dr. Edward A. Doisy for his research into the discovery of Vitamin K. One of the members of Doisy's research team that was responsible for this remarkable scientific breakthrough was Eureka College's own Professor Stephen B. Binkley (Class of 1934).</p>

It was on this date in <strong>1948</strong> that the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights was finally adopted by the member nations meeting in Paris. This document has been described as a "mission statement" for the world, and it is generally considered to be one of the most important statements ever put forward to delineate those rights that are essential to the human condition.

Dr. Durward V. Sandifer (Class of 1924) was a career diplomat in the U.S. State Department. In 1948 he was working as the special assistant to Ambassador Eleanor Roosevelt at the time that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was being considered. It was Sandifer who prepared the working draft of the Declaration of Human Rights that was debated, revised, and eventually enacted by the United Nations.

On <strong>December 11, 1918</strong>, the Student Army Training Corps (SATC) was disbanded on the Eureka College campus&mdash;exactly one month after the Armistice had been signed ending the fighting in the First World War. The SATC had existed at Eureka since the United States had joined the conflict in April 1917. A significant number of young men had come to the campus for training before their departure for Europe.

During this time the newly-constructed Pritchard Gymnasium was converted into a barracks-style facility to house the young men who were training in the SATC. Campus grounds and the Athletic Park were transformed into locations where military drill, marching, and calisthenics were taught.

In <strong>1961</strong>, Eureka College singers were featured in a televised Christmas music program that was developed by WEEK-TV, the NBC television affiliate in Peoria.

[John] Neil "Moon" Reagan (Class of 1933) died on this date in <strong>1996</strong>. The elder brother of President Ronald W. Reagan, "Moon" Reagan had been a friend of Eureka College throughout his life. As a graduate of the College, a member of the Board of Trustees for many years, and as a generous supporter of the institution, "Moon" Reagan truly personified the spirit of Eureka.

Neil "Moon" Reagan eventually settled in California where he became involved in real estate and advertising. He eventually retired in the community of Rancho Sante Fe, California. In 1970, Eureka College honored both Neil and Ronald Reagan by naming the Reagan Physical Education Center in their honor.

Those who attended college with "Moon" Reagan claim that he had a great sense of humor and was one of the world's greatest practical jokers. Though the archival evidence has not yet been found, there is anecdotal evidence that suggests "Moon" Reagan's most remarkable practical joke involved getting a cow up to the third floor of the Administration Building.

On <strong>December 12, 1890</strong>, Nancy J. Ledgerwood Burgess informed the Trustees of Eureka College of her intent to offer a tract if land near Forrest, Illinois, the sale of which would provide start-up funds for constructing a memorial to her husband Otis Asa Burgess. The $10,000 that was acquired through the sale of this property provided nearly half of the $21,000 that was needed to construct Burgess Memorial Hall.
