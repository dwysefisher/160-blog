On Aug. 16, 2000, the demolition of Lida's Wood residence hall began. The demolition of the structure and the removal of debris would be completed over the following 10 days.

The Lida's Wood that was removed was not the original structure to bear that name. The original home of local attorney Robert T. Cassell was constructed in 1869. The Metamora lawyer had moved to Eureka and constructed a home here while his daughter attended Eureka College. The home was sold in the early 1880s to Wallace J. and Mary Ford who had moved to Illinois shortly after the death of President James Garfield. Ford had been the private secretary to Garfield.

Lida Ford, the young daughter of the Ford family, died at the residence on April 21, 1887. Shortly after her death, the Ford family decided to deed the home to Eureka College provided that it become a residence hall for women. The college agreed to do so and also agreed to two other stipulations in the original deed. The name of the residence hall had to memorialize Lida and the college had to add an annex onto the existing home to accommodate its use as a residence hall.

That original Lida's Wood burned on Jan. 11, 1894.

The building was quickly reconstructed and was back in use as a completely new structure by 1895. For many of the next 105 years, Lida's Wood would be the social center of the campus. The campus dining hall was located there prior to the construction of Dickinson Commons in 1962, and Ronald Reagan, Class of 1932, washed dishes in the kitchen when he was a student at Eureka College.

Throughout its history, some maintained that the building was haunted by the benevolent ghost of Lida who did everything that she could to prevent another fire from destroying her home.

By the 1990s, as it celebrated its centennial, Lida's Wood was truly showing its age. Deterioration of the architectural infrastructure had become a significant problem. The foundation of red brick upon which the hastily constructed 1895 structure had been built was beginning to crumble. As such, structural problems were many.

The building was closed to student use during the 1999-2000 school year as a feasibility study was completed to determine whether the building could and should be renovated or whether the removal of the structure was necessary. When architectural reports indicated that the cost of renovations would be greater than half the cost of constructing a new building, the Board of Trustees decided in May 2000 to remove the structure.

On Aug. 19, 1989, emeritus professor of religion and philosophy Royal Humbert died at age 79. Named after the legendary Christian missionary Royal Dye, it seem almost natural that Royal Humbert would eventually become a noted theologian and professor of religion and philosophy at Eureka College. He joined the faculty in 1948 and taught until his retirement in the mid-1970s. His wife, Lois, joined the faculty in 1954 as professor of piano and organ and director of the handbell choir.

Professor Humbert was known for being a rigorous teacher and a productive scholar. During his tenure at Eureka College he produced A Compend of Alexander Campbell's Theology, with Commentary in the Form of Critical and Historical Footnotes. Edited by Royal Humbert. (St. Louis: Bethany Press, 1961).

Upon his retirement, the college established the Humbert Lecture Series to honor him. This endowed lecture series examines issues of theological or philosophical importance in the context of contemporary public life.
