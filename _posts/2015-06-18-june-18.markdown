On June 14, 1926, the Lincoln Stone was dedicated upon the Eureka College campus. The 4,150-pound boulder was put in place to commemorate the visit that Abraham Lincoln made to the campus in October 1856. Lincoln spoke in the chapel of the Walnut Grove Academy building on behalf of John Fremont's campaign for the presidency. Fremont was the first Republican Party candidate to seek the presidency.

What is especially remarkable about the 1926 dedication ceremony is that there were five individuals present who had also been present to hear Lincoln speak at the Walnut Grove Academy 75 years earlier. These individuals were:
 <ul>
  <li>Professor Benjamin J. Radford Jr., Class of 1866</li>
  <li>W. A. Davidson</li>
  <li>Dr. Napoleon Bonaparte Crawford</li>
  <li>Joel Dunn, Class of 1871</li>
  <li>Miss Emma Scott</li>
 </ul>

Radford spoke at the dedication ceremony and reminisced about the unanticipated visit that Lincoln made in 1856. Another speaker at the dedication ceremony was a geologist who traced the origins of the boulder by describing the Ice Age natural history of central Illinois. The boulder itself had been found in a field near the village of Cruger and was donated to the Woodford County Historical Society by farmers L.J. and G.W. Freese.

In 2012 the stone received a facelift. Workers cleaned it with a light sandblasting, flipped it over and created a new engraving on what used to be the bottom of the rock. They then filled in the new engraving with black paint to make the words "Lincoln spoke here in 1856" easily readable.
