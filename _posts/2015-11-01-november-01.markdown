John Darst was born in Ohio on this <strong>November 6, 1816</strong>. Darst moved his family to Walnut Grove/Eureka in 1851 and quickly became involved in the life of the village and the educational institution that had been founded here shortly before his arrival.

Darst became one of the greatest "boosters" of both the town of Eureka and of Eureka College for the remainder of his life. He served for forty years on the Board of Trustees, and he chaired that body from 1873-95. He was always one of the strongest financial supporters of the institution.

Darst was a member of the Christian Church and he was an abolitionist. During the Civil War, five of his sons served in the Union Army.
